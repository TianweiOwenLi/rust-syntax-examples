# Rust Syntax Examples

## Purpose
This file is intended to be a cheatsheet for **Rust** syntax, and serves as a complement to [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). 

## How to Access
Simply look at `src/main.rs`. A list of functions appear above `main`, each of which demonstrates a particular syntax / feature of **Rust**.

## Note
This file is still being written. It is incomplete and prone to errors, mostly due to the author being completely new to **Rust** (started learning it a week ago). Frequent updates will be made.
